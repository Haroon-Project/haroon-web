    <div class="section">
        <p>Utilitarianism is a consequentialist ethical theory that evaluates the morality of actions based on their outcomes. Developed by philosophers Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, utilitarianism promotes the principle of achieving "the greatest good for the greatest number." In the context of ethical decision-making, this theory provides a systematic approach for choosing actions that maximize overall happiness or utility while minimizing harm.</p>

        <p>Utilitarianism is widely applied in sectors such as business, public policy, and healthcare. For instance, it can justify distributing limited vaccines to high-density areas or support layoffs for long-term business sustainability. Its strength lies in its practicality and measurable outcomes, although critics argue it can sometimes permit morally questionable actions if the outcome benefits the majority.</p>

    <h2>Introduction to Ethical Decision-Making</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>Ethical decision-making involves determining the right thing to do in various situations. Ethical theories like virtue ethics, deontology, and utilitarianism help individuals and societies make judgments about moral dilemmas. These models provide structured reasoning to assess right and wrong.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Deontology</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>Originating from Immanuel Kant, deontological ethics focus on the principle that actions are right or wrong based on their adherence to rules and duties, not outcomes. It's common in legal and professional settings, though sometimes criticized for ignoring consequences in decision-making.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Virtue Ethics</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>Based on Aristotle’s philosophy, virtue ethics emphasizes character and moral virtues such as honesty and courage. It's especially useful in leadership and personal development but may lack clarity in specific dilemmas.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <div class="section">
        <p>By analyzing and comparing ethical theories, this overview shows how different models influence moral decision-making. Understanding their strengths and limitations helps apply these frameworks more effectively in real-world scenarios.</p>
